**Olympic Summary from 1896 to 2022**
Project Overview
This project aims to enhance my Power BI skills by analyzing Olympic data from 1896 to 2022. The dataset I am using contains detailed information on athletes, events, and country-wise medal tallies, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of Olympic history and trends.

**Dataset Information**
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle and includes the following tables:
Athlete_bio: Information about athletes including name, gender, country, and sport.
Event_result: Details about each event, including event name, year, and medal type.
Game_medals_tally: The medal count for each Olympic Game by country.
Olympic_country: Information on countries participating in the Olympics.
Olympic_games: Information on each Olympic Game, including year, host city, and participating countries.

**Key Insights**
Medal Trends: Visualizing which countries have won the most medals across different years and how certain countries have dominated particular sports.
Event Performance: Insights into which sports or events are more likely to award medals and how performances have evolved over time.
Country Participation: Analyzing which countries participate in specific events and how their participation trends have changed.
Athlete Achievements: Highlighting top athletes in terms of medals won across different editions of the Olympic Games.

**Power BI Visualizations**
I have built several Power BI dashboards to present meaningful insights from this data:
1) Overall Medal Count: Visualization of gold, silver, and bronze medals won by country across all games.
2) Country-wise Medal Distribution: Analysis of medal distribution across different Country.
3) Top Country: Dashboards showcasing the top country by medal count.
4) Medales vs Time: Visualizing Medal achievements across different years.
5) gender breakdown
6) Athletes category in respected year
7) olympic held countries.
etc.

**How to Use**
Download the dataset from Kaggle and load it into Power BI.
Open the Power BI report file to explore the visualizations and insights.
Customize the dashboards to suit your analytical goals.

**Future Improvements**
Incorporate more detailed data on athlete performances and historical context for each event.
Use machine learning models to predict future medal counts based on historical data.
Add interactive filtering for more detailed event- or country-specific insights.

**Suggestions and Feedback**
Iâ€™m open to any suggestions on how to improve the analysis or visualizations. Feel free to contribute by opening a pull request or sharing feedback in the issues section.
